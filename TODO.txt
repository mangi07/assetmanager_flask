Need to test location tree creation

See 
queries/location_queries.py
for an example of what's needed.

Find a way to create a tree with two passes on list of locations from db:

First pass inserts nodes,
Second pass inserts the parent of each node,

Because the current bug is where there is no parent yet for some nodes as they are being created.
