Background:
Package cryptography in requirements.txt has issued in a Cygwin environment, and it may be good anyway to update the method used to generate and check
these security keys that are used to guard file access.


Prompt used:
How might I refactor this class to provide the same (or better or updated) encrypting and decrypting using a library such as PyCryptodome or CryptoPy ?


Answer:
To refactor your `FileGuardian` class to use [PyCryptodome](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/) (which is modern, well-maintained, and recommended), you’ll want to choose a symmetric encryption algorithm. **AES-GCM** is a great choice for both confidentiality and integrity.

Below is a refactored version of your class using **PyCryptodome**'s AES-GCM.  
**Key points:**
- The token contains the encrypted message, the nonce (needed for decryption), and the authentication tag (to verify integrity).
- The key should be 16, 24, or 32 bytes (AES-128/192/256).
- We'll base64-encode the token for safe transport.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import base64
import os

class FileGuardian:
    def __init__(self):
        # AES key should be 16, 24, or 32 bytes for AES-128/192/256
        with open('./keys/file_access.txt', 'rb') as f:
            key = f.readline().strip()
            # If your file contains a string, decode it or use base64 if you store it that way
            if len(key) not in (16, 24, 32):
                raise ValueError("Key must be 16, 24, or 32 bytes long")
            self.key = key

    def _get_message(self):
        return str(datetime.now())

    def issue_file_access_token(self):
        message = self._get_message().encode('utf-8')
        cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_GCM)
        ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(message)
        # Token = nonce + tag + ciphertext, all base64-encoded
        token = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(cipher.nonce + tag + ciphertext).decode('utf-8')
        return token

    def _decrypt_file_access_token(self, token):
        raw = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(token)
        nonce = raw[:16]
        tag = raw[16:32]
        ciphertext = raw[32:]
        cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce=nonce)
        message = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)
        return message

    def access_allowed(self, token):
        now = datetime.now()
        try:
            issued_at_bytes = self._decrypt_file_access_token(token)
            issued_at_str = issued_at_bytes.decode("utf-8")
            issued_at = datetime.strptime(issued_at_str, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f")
        except Exception as e:
            return False, f'Bad file access token. {str(e)}'
        age = now - issued_at
        allowed_age = timedelta(hours=24)
        allowed = age < allowed_age
        if allowed:
            return allowed, f"File access granted with token issued at {issued_at}."
        else:
            return allowed, 'File access token has expired.'
```

### Notes:

- **Key handling:** Always use a securely generated key, and keep it safe. If your key is stored as a string, be sure to decode appropriately.
- **Token format:** The token is nonce + tag + ciphertext, all base64-encoded. This is a common pattern with AES-GCM.
- **Integrity:** AES-GCM ensures both confidentiality and authenticity.
- **Error handling:** Any tampering with the token will raise an exception during decryption or verification.

**You do not need to use CryptoPy** (which is old and generally not recommended).  
PyCryptodome is the modern standard for Python cryptography.

Let me know if you’d like an example of secure key generation or suggestions for further improvements!
